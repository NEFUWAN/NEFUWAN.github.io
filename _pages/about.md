I'm a first-year master's student from [School of ELE](https://ele.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes device reliability, computer vision, and FPGA.

I am extremely fortunate to have received guidance from Professor [Wang Dan](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/alexaustin) of the Microelectronics Laboratory, who is from the [Microelectronics Institute](https://ele.xjtu.edu.cn/) of Xi'an Jiaotong University.
